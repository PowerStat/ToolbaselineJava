# PowerStat's Toolbaseline for Java

This is my [ToolbaselineJava](https://www.powerstat.de/ToolbaselineJava.html).

## Installation

Because this library is only useful for developers the installation depends on your build environment.

For example when using Apache Maven you could add the following dependency to your project:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.powerstat.toolbaseline</groupId>
      <artifactId>tbljava</artifactId>
      <version>11.0.0</version>
    </dependency>

Also please copy the `checkstyle-config.xml` and `PMD.xml` into your project.


Other build tools like gradle will work analogous.

To compile this project yourself you could use:

    mvn clean install site
    
or simply:

     mvn clean install
     
To find newer dependencies:

    mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
    
To find newer plugins:

    mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
    
To make a new release:

    mvn --batch-mode release:clean release:prepare release:perform
    git push -â€“tags
    git push origin master
        
To run toolchain:
