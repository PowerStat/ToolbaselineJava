# PowerStat's Toolbaseline for Java

This is my [ToolbaselineJava](https://www.powerstat.de/ToolbaselineJava.html).

## Installation

Because this library is only useful for developers the installation depends on your build environment.

For example when using Apache Maven you could add the following dependency to your project:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.powerstat.toolbaseline</groupId>
      <artifactId>tbljava</artifactId>
      <version>17.2.0</version>
    </dependency>

Also please copy the `checkstyle-config.xml` and `PMD.xml` into your project.
Please add the following entry to your maven `settings.xml`:

    <server>
      <id>nvd</id>
      <password>nvd api-key</password>
    </server>

The API-Key could be requested here: [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key)


Other build tools like gradle will work analogous.

To compile this project yourself you could use:

    mvn clean install site
    
or simply:

     mvn clean install

or for native image creation:

On windows Visual Studio 2022 is required and you have to call:

    "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" > nul

Compile and build image:

    mvn clean -Pnative package
    
Run the image:

    ./target/[imagename]

To find newer dependencies:

    mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
    
To find newer plugins:
